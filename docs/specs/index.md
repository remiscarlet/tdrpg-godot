# Specs / Plans Index

| id | title | status | owner | linked ADRs | last updated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *(add first spec)* | | | | | |

## How to use this index
- Add a row for every spec file in `docs/specs/`.
- Keep `status` in {Draft, Active, Retired}.
- `linked ADRs` should list ADR numbers (e.g., 0001) or `n/a` if none.
- Update `last updated` when materially changing a spec.
